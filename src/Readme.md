Another way to deal with the given problem is to write SQL query.

The following query will be used in this order: 
select, count(*), where, group by, order by (DESC), limit num;

To get the top 10 occupations 
''' 
select CASE_STATUS, SOC_NAME, count(*) as CNT from H1B_test 
		where CASE_STATUS = 'CERTIFIED' 
		group by SOC_NAME 
		order by CNT DESC
		limit 10;
''' 

To get the top 10 states

''' 
select CASE_STATUS, WORKSITE_STATE, count(*) as CNTfrom H1B_test 
	where CASE_STATUS = 'CERTIFIED' 
	group by WORKSITE_STATE 
	order by CNT DESC
		limit 10
'''

And one has to transfer the delimeter ';' to ',' and saved the raw data in a csvfile. 
Also, one has to create a new table in MySQL. The table should have the same fields as the csvfile. 
Then import the CSV file to the table in MySQL.
